# task_manager
I created this program for a small business users to add, track and view their individual tasks or the total amount of tasks for the company. 
Admins are also able to add new users to the program, and display statistics regarding the company.

The user.txt file saves all the usernames and passwords of the company users.
The tasks.txt file saves the names, task titles, task descriptions, the date it was issued, and the date it needs to be completed by.
